# Reinforcement Learning projetcs

In this repository, you can find Reinforcement Learning projetcs I have done in OpenAI gym environments.

## Environments solved:

- [Classic Control](https://github.com/Sohaib1424/Reinforcement-Learning-projects/tree/main/ClassicControl)
  * [MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/Sohaib1424/Reinforcement-Learning-projects/tree/main/ClassicControl/MountainCar-v0.py)
  * [CartPole-v1](https://github.com/Sohaib1424/Reinforcement-Learning-projects/tree/main/ClassicControl/CartPole-v1.py)

## Algorithms used:

- Classic Control
  * Q_Learning
  * semi-gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
  * Differential semi_gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
  * Actor-Critic with softmax with Tile Coding
