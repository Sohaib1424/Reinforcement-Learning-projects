# Reinforcement Learning projetcs

In this repository, you can find Reinforcement Learning projetcs I have done in OpenAI gym environments.

## Environments solved:

- [Classic Control](https://github.com/Sohaib1424/Reinforcement-Learning-projects/tree/main/ClassicControl)
  * [MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/Sohaib1424/Reinforcement-Learning-projects/tree/main/ClassicControl/MountainCar-v0)


## Algorithms used in each environment:

- MountainCar-v0
  * Q_Learning
  * semi-gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
  * Differential semi_gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
  * Actor-Critic with softmax with Tile Coding
