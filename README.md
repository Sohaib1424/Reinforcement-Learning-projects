# Reinforcement Learning projetcs

In this repository, you can find Reinforcement Learning projetcs I have done in OpenAI gym environments.
the ipynb files descriptions are as followed:

1- ClassicControl.ipynb: solving classic control problems such as MountainCar-v0, CartPole-v1, etc. with the following algorithms:
- Q_Learning
- semi-gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
- Differential semi_gradient SARSA with Tile Coding
- Actor-Critic with softmax with Tile Coding
